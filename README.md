## Configuration [WIP]

Before using Yasuho, you need to set up your configuration. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `bot.ini` file based on the provided template.
2. Fill in your bot's specific details, including your bot token and other necessary settings.
3. - Setting Up a PostgreSQL Database: If you plan to use a PostgreSQL database, follow the instructions in the [Yasuho Wiki](https://github.com/yaniswav/Yasuho/wiki/Setting-Up-a-PostgreSQL-Database) to set it up correctly.

Example `bot.ini` file:

```ini
[BotInfo]
ClientID = YOUR_CLIENT_ID
DefaultPrefix = YOUR_DEFAULT_PREFIX
Token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
...

[Extension]
Extensions = 
    cogs.extension1
    cogs.extension2
    ...
```

3. Create a `tokens.ini` file for any external API tokens.

Example `tokens.ini` file:

```ini
[Website_Tokens]
topGG = "YOUR_TOPGG_TOKEN"
DBL = "YOUR_DBL_TOKEN"
...

[API_Tokens]
nasaKey = "YOUR_NASA_API_KEY"
weatherKey = "YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY"
...
```

4. Save both files in the `config` directory.
